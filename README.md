Tech Stack used: torchvision, PyTorch, Numpy, CNN

In Assignment 4, the task was implementing and exploring convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.
The assignment focuses on latent features obtained through convolutional layers and their visualization using deconvolution.
The first task involves replicating results from a provided tutorial on CIFAR-10 classification.
The second task extends the model to incorporate deconvolutional layers for latent feature visualization, with a report on classification errors and reconstructed images.
The third task further analyzes latent representations by selectively zeroing out channels and discussing patterns in the reconstructed images.
This assignment offers a practical application of CNNs and deconvolution, enhancing understanding of image classification and feature visualization in neural networks.
